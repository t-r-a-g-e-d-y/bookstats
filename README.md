Little tool for pulling stats from my book log.

Provides basic stats such as:  
Books read by year  
Books read by author  
Count per year  
Count per author  

Example usage:  
`python -m bookstats ~/books.txt --all-tally`

~~Includes an interactive mode for printing stats and searching the log by book or author.~~  

Log format is simply:

YEAR  
Title (Author First, Last Middle) (Date Finished)

Title, Author, and Date are tab (\t) separated

I use vim to edit my book log and include this modeline at the bottom of the log:  
`# vim: set expandtab& ts=8 sts=8 sw=8:`

Example log (excluding modeline):

```
2019
Slaughterhouse-Five	(Vonnegut, Kurt)	(1/3)
Anna Karenina	(Tolstoy, Leo)	(2/8)
War and Peace	(Tolstoy, Leo)	(5/11)
```
